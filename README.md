# 🌊 Aquatech AI Assistant Demo

🧠 **A demo repository showcasing the architecture and functionality of the AI assistant I developed.**  
This is **not the full production system**, but rather a **demonstration of the project’s structure, design, and capabilities**.  
It exists to visually and technically show how my AI assistant works — through organized code, architecture, and an upcoming **video walkthrough** that explains how everything connects.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This repository does **not** include any confidential code, internal data, or deployment credentials.  
It is a **simplified public version** created solely for **demonstration and portfolio** purposes.

## 🧩 About the Project

The **Aquatech AI Assistant** is a full-stack knowledge assistant designed to help engineering teams query internal documents and data using AI.  
This demo repository showcases the **system architecture** — from backend RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) to the frontend Teams interface — representing how the real product was structured and integrated.

### 🔹 Core Features
- 🧠 **AI-powered document understanding** using LangChain + FAISS  
- 💬 **Conversational frontend prototype** built with React + Microsoft Teams Toolkit  
- ⚙️ **FastAPI backend** that handles search, retrieval, and GPT responses  
- ☁️ **Production-style architecture** mimicking AWS + Nginx deployment structure  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Microsoft Teams Toolkit, Vite  
**Backend:** FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI API  
**Infra (for demo):** Simulated AWS EC2 + Nginx environment  

---

## 🧠 What the Real Project Achieved
- Built a **retrieval-augmented AI assistant** for industrial data search  
- Deployed a **production-grade backend** on AWS EC2 with SSL  
- Integrated **GPT-based Q&A** into Microsoft Teams for internal use  
- Logged and analyzed **user queries** to improve retrieval accuracy

## 💡 What I Learned

This project taught me how to bridge **AI concepts with real-world engineering workflows** — from building scalable APIs to integrating them into user-facing tools.  
I learned how to design systems that balance reliability, usability, and intelligence.

Key takeaways:
- 🚀 **End-to-end system design:** Connecting a LangChain-based backend with a Teams frontend using REST APIs and FastAPI.  
- 🧩 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Structuring document data and embeddings for efficient FAISS vector search.  
- ⚙️ **Deployment fundamentals:** Running FastAPI on AWS EC2 behind Nginx with HTTPS using Certbot.  
- 🧠 **LLM prompting and evaluation:** Fine-tuning retrieval quality and response relevance through iterative testing.  
- 💬 **UI/UX for AI tools:** Building an interface that makes AI interactions intuitive inside Microsoft Teams.  
- 🔒 **Security and privacy awareness:** Managing environment variables, private keys, and safe `.gitignore` practices.

Overall, this project helped me move from *using* AI tools to *engineering* full-stack AI systems that solve practical problems.
